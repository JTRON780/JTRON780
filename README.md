ðŸ‘‹ Hello!
Thanks for checking out my profile!

I'm currently working on some Discord bots (superpenguin612/discord-bots), some CyberPatriot resources (private repo to comply with competition rules), and I'm studying competitive programming/algorithms for USACO. Also, I'm getting ready to start a big project over at superpenguin612/ccs-connect.
